intro: >-
  I'm a product designer working on consumer experiences, mobile apps, and
  design systems. My experiences span developing design systems, brand
  identities, and both web and mobile experiences.


  Currently I'm working as the product design lead at [Good Dog](https://www.gooddog.com/) and consulting with early-stage startups. I was previously at [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/), and [Artsy](https://www.artsy.net/).
